### About

The name for the website was inspired by a class of the very interesting theorems known as *fixed-point
theorems*.  A **fixed-point** for a function $f$ is a point $x$ such that $f(x)$ and $x$ are equivalent
(often, but not always, equivalency is equality). In short, $x$ is a fixed-point of $f$ if 
$f$ does not materially change $x$.  The fixed point theorems often have a form stating that some collection
of functions are guaranteed to have fixed points.  Some examples are:  

- [The Diagonal lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma) which is used in the proof of Godel's incompleteness theorems
- [Roger's fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_recursion_theorem#Rogers's_fixed-point_theorem) stating that total computable functions have fixed points.  Kleene's second recursion theorem is a generalization which gives something like a parametric fixed-point
- [The fixed-point lemma for normal ordinal functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_lemma_for_normal_functions) a basic result in combinatorial set theory
- [Brouwer's fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem) which guarantees that continuous functions mapping a compact set to itself has a fixed point  
  
I have always found these type of theorems very intriguing, especially the fixed-point 
theorems from logic, computability theory, and set theory.  I plan to add content to the website which 
I have found interesting, useful, or funâ€”-things that I have spent some 
amount of time with or have come back to regularly.  In some sense then, the content will reflect personal fixed-points.
