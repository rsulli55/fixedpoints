### Welcome
Hi, I'm Ryan, I am currently a software engineer at Sandia National Labs. 
Prior to starting at Sandia, I completed an M.S. in computer science at the University of Arizona, and a Ph.D.
in mathematics at UC Irvine studying set theory.

Most of the posts on this site will fall into one of my technical interests 
which include C++, development best practices and tools, functional programming, emulation,
and Linux.
